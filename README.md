# EDA_cars
This is exploratory data analysis for different models of cars from car sales advertisements dataset.

* My project will help solve the problem of indecisiveness faced by buyers when they plan to buy a used car.
* It will help buyers to do cost benefit analysis based on condion, type and transmission so that they can take informed action. 
* It also helps to see price fluctuation based on color, days listed and odometer. 
* Laslty taking a look at the conditions of the older models of car. So that they can purchase an older model if the condition is decent as the prices are cheaper for older cars.
