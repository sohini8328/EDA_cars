This is exploratory data analysis for different models of cars.

My project helps buyers to do cost benefit analysis based on condion, type, odometer and transmission so that they can make an informed decision. It also helps to see price fluctuation based on color, days listed and odometer. 
Laslty taking a look at the conditions of the older models of car. So that they can purchase a older model if the condition is decent as the prices are cheaper
